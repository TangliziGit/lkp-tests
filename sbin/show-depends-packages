# This script is used to get dependency packages for determined os distribution

# There are two sources to get these packages names:
# 1. $LKP_SRC/distro/depends/*, files here contain dependency packages names
# 2. $LKP_SRC/distro/adaptation/$distro, the $distro contains packages mapping
# from debian to other os, Default file is $1, if not found, get centos then.
