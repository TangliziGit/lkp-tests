 AIM7 is a traditional UNIX system level benchmark suite which is used to
 test and measure the performance of multiuser system.

description: |
 AIM7 is a program written in C that forks many processes called
 tasks, each of which concurrently runs in random order a set of
 subtests called jobs. There are 53 kinds of jobs, each of which
 exercises a different aspect of the operating system, such as
 disk-file operations, process creation, user virtual memory
 operations, pipe I/O, and compute-bound arithmetic loops.
