 The Linpack Benchmark is a measure of a computerâ€™s floating-point rate of
 execution.

 The LINPACK Benchmarks are a measure of a system's floating point computing
 power. Introduced by Jack Dongarra, they measure how fast a computer solves a
 dense n by n system of linear equations Ax = b, which is a common task in
 engineering.

 The latest version of these benchmarks is used to build the TOP500 list,
 ranking the world's most powerful supercomputers.

 The aim is to approximate how fast a computer will perform when solving real
 problems. It is a simplification, since no single computational task can
 reflect the overall performance of a computer system. Nevertheless, the
 LINPACK benchmark performance can provide a good correction over the peak
 performance provided by the manufacturer. The peak performance is the maximal
 theoretical performance a computer can achieve, calculated as the machine's
 frequency, in cycles per second, times the number of operations per cycle it
 can perform. The actual performance will always be lower than the peak
 performance. The performance of a computer is a complex issue that depends on
 many interconnected variables. The performance measured by the LINPACK
 benchmark consists of the number of 64-bit floating-point operations,
 generally additions and multiplications, a computer can perform per second,
 also known as FLOPS. However, a computer's performance when running actual
 applications is likely to be far behind the maximal performance it achieves
 running the appropriate LINPACK benchmark.
