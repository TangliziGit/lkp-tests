        summary: Network benchmarking utility for testing latency and throughput
        description: |
         sockperf is a network benchmarking utility over socket API that was
         designed for testing performance (latency and throughput) of
         high-performance systems (it is also good for testing performance of
         regular networking systems as well). It covers most of the socket API
         calls and options.
