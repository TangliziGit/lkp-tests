 The kernel contains a set of "self tests" under the tools/testing/selftests/
 directory. These are intended to be small unit tests to exercise individual
 code paths in the kernel.

 On some systems, hot-plug tests could hang forever waiting for cpu and memory
 to be ready to be offlined. A special hot-plug target is created to run full
 range of hot-plug tests. In default mode, hot-plug tests run in safe mode with
 a limited scope. In limited mode, cpu-hotplug test is run on a single cpu as
 opposed to all hotplug capable cpus, and memory hotplug test is run on 2% of
 hotplug capable memory instead of 10%.
