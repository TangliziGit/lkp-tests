 qperf measures bandwidth and latency between two nodes. It can work over
 TCP/IP as well as the RDMA transports. On one of the nodes, qperf is typically
 run with no arguments designating it the server node. One may then run qperf
 on a client node to obtain measurements such as bandwidth, latency and cpu
 utilization.

 In its most basic form, qperf is run on one node in server mode by invoking it
 with no arguments. On the other node, it is run with two arguments, the name
 of the server node followed by the name of the test. A list of tests can be
 found in the section, TESTS. A variety of options may also be specified.
