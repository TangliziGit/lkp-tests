# cgroup controllers can only be mounted in one hierarchy (v1 or v2).
# If a controller mounted on a legacy v1, then it won't show up in cgroup2.
# the v1 controllers are automatically mounted under /sys/fs/cgroup.
# systemd automatically creates such mount points. mount_cgroup dosen't work.
# not all controllers (like memory) become available even after unmounting all v1 cgroup filesystems.
# To avoid this behavior, boot with the systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1.
